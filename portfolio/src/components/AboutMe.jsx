        <h2>Hi, I'm Ashlan Filbrun. Welcome!</h2>
        <h3>I enjoy traveling the world, discovering new restaurants, going on adventures, keeping up with groundbreaking medical research, and geeking out on everything involving space (as you may be able to tell from a few of my projects),</h3>
        <h3>and I am a software engineer.</h3>
        <h3>I was born and raised in California and moved to super sunny Phoenix, Arizona in 2017. </h3>
        <h3> I am determined, hard-working, highly communicative, and constantly striving for growth in all aspects of my life, but especially as a software engineer and web developer.</h3>
        <h3>
        I am looking for full-time employment as a software engineer and I hope you'll consider me for the role.</h3>
